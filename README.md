## Key Features
- Queries 19 online databases at the same time and selects/adds the most common results.
  This means, if for example 10 webservices respond with "Beyonc√©" as artist name and only 5 webservices say it's "Beyonce" (note the difference) than the
  program assumes that the majority is right and selects the first variant. This is the way it works for all tags
- Supports the following ID3v2.3 tags
  - **Artist name**
  - **Track title**
  - **Album name**
  - **Release date**
  - **Genre**
